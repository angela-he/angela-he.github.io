        <h1>Arcadia — <br>Modular newsletter suite</h1>
        <p class="w-80-l">I designed a modular newsletter suite for The Atlantic’s newsletters, which launched with the redesign of the flagship The Atlantic Daily. I also wrote <a class="link" title="Arcadia" target="_blank" href="https://building.theatlantic.com/a-better-way-to-build-newsletters-at-the-atlantic-81d4c5db9525">a Medium post</a> about how the process went.</p>

        <h2 class="w-80-l center">Problem</h2>
        <p class="w-80-l center pb4">The newsletters infrastructure was showing it’s age. Originally built with limited styling, the newsroom needed a richer editorial toolkit to spin up various newsletter formats, and we wanted a more flexible backend to evolve newsletters as a standalone editorial product. </p>

        <h2 class="w-80-l center">Initial research</h2>
        <p class="w-80-l center pb4">I surveyed designs from a variety of other popular media newsletters: NYTimes The Daily, The Skimm, Morning Brew, Quartz Weekly Obsession, Medium Tech Brief, etc,<br><br>
        I also interviewed editors to understand newsroom needs and came up with a list of formats to support: photo essays, interviews, excerpts, timelines, news roundups, feature stories... the list goes on and on.</p>

        <h2 class="w-80-l center">Goals</h2>
        <ul class="w-80-l center pb4">
            <li>Create a flexible, modular system for endless layout combinations</li>
            <li>Allow for unique styling across newsletters while maintaining brand cohesion</li>
            <li>Empower editors to spin up new newsletters without heavy engineering help</li>
            <li>Support various email clients (hello, Outlook), browsers, and device types</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="w-80-l center">Wireframes</h2>
        <p class="w-80-l center pb4">I designed multiple iterations of various components, focusing on various heading styles and combinations, quote sections, images, and author bylines. Through multiple reviews with editorial and product/engineering stakeholders, a range of components and selected heading 1-4 styles were refined.</p>

        <div class="dtc-ns tc">
                <img src="images/newsletters/wireframe1.png" class="pt3"><p><em>Explorations for various newsletters</em></p>

                <img src="images/newsletters/wireframe2.png" class="pt3"><p><em>Breakdown of modules in use</em></p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="w-80-l center">Final designs</h2>
        <p class="w-80-l center pb4">The timing of our newsletter suite redesign coincided with an ambitious overhaul of our flagship newsletter, The Atlantic Daily. Using the styled components, I created a layout that gave the newsletter an airier, more modern look, as well as highlighting it as a platform to provide context on the big stories of the day, feature the range of our coverage, and resurface gems from our archives. <br><br>

        A prototype of the design can be <a class="link" title="Arcadia" target="_blank" href="https://atlanticmedia.invisionapp.com/console/share/NXR1ED3YSJR">viewed here</a>. The various header components, sponsor tags, quotes, section dividers, accent sections, house promos, and a streamlined footer created an easier to digest newsletter, and a survey of readers said they found the new version “more lively” and cleaner, compared to the old newsletter, which was “daunting” to read.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class="w-80-l center">Documentation</h2>
        <p class="w-80-l center pb4">As a firm advocate for thorough documentation, I created a few artifacts to document the newsletter suite, including a component list and a styleguide for editorial. This documentation will result in fewer inconsistencies and allow future newsletter to be spun up following these guidelines, as well as serve as a place to note any future changes and improvements as The Atlantic’s newsletters grow. </p>

        </div><br>

        <h2 class="w-80-l center">Aftermath</h2>
        <p class="w-80-l center pb5">After I left my role at The Atlantic, various newsletters have been built or relaunched with these newsletter components. <a class="link" title="Arcadia" target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/daily/">The Atlantic Daily</a> refreshed their brand following the entire magazine redesign, and the components held up to this redesign. Weekly Planet also launched using the newsletter suite. Always rewarding as a designer to see your work live on afterwards. </p>
