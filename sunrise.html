                        <p>I led the redesign of the community solar dashboard experience, guiding customers through the steps of joining a local, remote solar project.</p>

                        <p class="sub-title">Overview</p>
                        <p>Community solar is a program that allows renters and homeowners to subscribe to remote solar projects by redirecting their energy bills towards the upkeep of a local solar project. In return, the solar energy produced by the project is sold back to the grid, and subscribers receive a discount on their energy bill for helping produce clean energy. It's a win-win-win situation.<br><br>
                        Arcadia's customer dashboard was stuck in the past; it primarily showed customers the legacy wind energy product and had a sparse solar experience, but the company had quickly become the leading community solar company in the market. With this shift, we needed to provide a comprehensive dashboard experience for community solar.
                        </p><br>
                            
                        <p class="sub-title">Goals</p>
                        <p>The existing solar page in the dashboard lacked information, didn't clarify next steps, and sorely needed a refresh. We knew that customers were dropping from their community solar projects because of misaligned expectations around what they had signed up for. <br><br>Our goal was to address these misaligned expectations by: 1) improving product comprehension by providing a clear explanation of how community solar works; 2) focusing on community-level impact prior to enrolling on a project; 3) showing clean energy impact and savings after enrolling on a project. 
                        </p><br>

                        <p class="sub-title">Wireframes and user testing</p>
                        <p>We wanted to make the dashboard more modular and flexible, and we had a lot of ideas on new modules to add, such as a welcome module, community solar overview card, project updates, state-level energy module, etc. I created initial sketches and low fidelity wireframes with these ideas in mind to visualize the various ways to display community-level impact and product explanations.</p><br>

                        </div><br>
                        
                        <p>After multiple rounds of stakeholder feedback and design critiques, I refined which modules to show and created a version of the solar page for each step of joining a solar project, from being pending as Arcadia determines a customer's project eligibility, to being on a project waitlist as the project is being constructed, to finally being enrolled and receiving solar credits. <br><br>
                        With these designs, I conducted user tests to determine: 1) how people interacted with these pages; 2) if the copy and UX were clear; 3) and how the designs felt as a part of the entire onboarding experience for community solar.</p><br>

                        <p class="sub-title">Final designs</p>
                        <p>User testing revealed that overall, the designs had high comprehension around the process of joining a community solar project, and some improvements were made to clarify project timelines and how billing worked. The final designs focused on clearly explaining the next steps of joining a solar project, along with visualizations of the renewable impact that the solar projects added to a customer‚Äôs local power grid.</p><br>

This improved dashboard has allowed us to build iterative features on top of the baseline solar experience, such as our advocacy tool.  </p><br>
