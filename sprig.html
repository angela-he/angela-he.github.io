        <h1>Sprig — <br>Dashboard features to collect user insights</h1>
        <p class="w-80-l">I currently lead design for the core dashboard team, which encompasses our Survey and Replay products. I’ve scoped, designed, and shipped key features, often flexing beyond my product designer role to conduct and analyze user research and write product requirements.</p> 
        <p class="w-80-l">Noteworthy projects include:<br></p>
        <ul class="w-80-l pb3">
            <li>launching Sprig Replays, an events-based session replay tool</li>
            <li>designing multi-language capabilities for Sprig Surveys</li>
            <li>PM-ing and designing our revamped Slack integration</li>
            <li>an exciting feature to create with AI (coming soon!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="w-80-l center pt3">Sprig Replays</h2>
        
        <p class="w-80-l center pb5">I led our Replay product to the launch finish line, collecting beta customer feedback and turning it into a cohesive experience for customers. <br><br>Replays capture clips of your users' product experience, and it's packed with useful features—clip &amp; survey view, speed controls, interaction log, share at timestamp, and more.

        <h2 class="w-80-l center pt3">Multi-language Surveys</h2>
        <p class="w-80-l center pb5">Highly requested by enterprise customers such as PayPal and Dropbox, I designed a feature to translate Sprig surveys into multiple languages. Tons of research calls and testing went into this to ensure the flow felt as scalable and seamless as possible.<br><br>This feature has impressive usage—one customer’s multi-language survey collected over 24,000 responses in 48 different languages within two weeks. </p>

        <img src="images/sprig/Slack-integration.png">
        
        <h2 class="w-80-l center pt3">Revamped Slack Integration (coming soon!)</h2>
        <p class="w-80-l center pb5">We’ve heard loud and clear from customers that they want to send survey responses to specific Slack channels. As both the product manager and product designer on this project, I gathered customer feedback, wrote product requirements, and designed and user tested a streamlined flow to connect surveys to unique Slack channels.<br><br>I currently oversee the engineering progress and release management. This integration is expected to release early 2024.</p>
